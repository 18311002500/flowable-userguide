(体系结构)

This chapter gives a short introduction to the internals of the CMMN engine from a high-level point of view. Of course, as the CMMN engine code is open source, the actual implementation details can be found by diving into the source code.
(本章从高层次的角度简要介绍了CMMN引擎的内部结构。当然，由于CMMN引擎代码是开源的，因此可以通过深入了解源代码来找到实际的实现细节。)

The CMMN engine, as shown in the diagram below, is one of the engines that is part of the Flowable engines eco-system and is designed in a similar way as the other engines. The CMMN engine builds upon CMMN specific services and the shared services: the task, variable, identity and job services, which are independent from the engines. On a lower level the entity- and datamanager layer takes care of the low-level persistence, equivalent to the other engines.
(如下图所示，CMMN引擎是Flowable引擎生态系统的一部分，其设计方式与其他引擎类似。CMMN引擎基于CMMN特定服务和共享服务构建：任务，变量，身份和作业服务，它们独立于引擎。 在较低级别，实体和数据管理器层负责低级别持久性，相当于其他引擎。)

By using the shared services, this also means that for example tasks from both the BPMN and the CMMN engine will end up together and can be queried and managed through the same API. Similarly for the async executor: timers and async jobs use the same logic and even can be managed by a central executor.
(通过使用共享服务，这也意味着例如来自BPMN和CMMN引擎的任务将最终结合在一起，并且可以通过相同的API查询和管理。类似地，对于异步执行器：定时器和异步作业使用相同的逻辑，甚至可以由中央执行器管理。)

The shared services architecture has a second benefit. When the engines are used together, as is often the case, the engines will share resources where possible, database transactions will span calls over multiple engines operations, lookup caches are common and persistency is handled independently from the engines itself.  
(共享服务架构有第二个好处。通常情况下，当引擎一起使用时，引擎将尽可能共享资源，数据库事务将跨越多个引擎操作的调用，查找缓存是常见的，并且持久性是独立于引擎本身处理的。)

The CMMN engine is designed with the same principles as the other engines of the Flowable project. The diagram below gives a high-level overview of the different components involved when working with the CMMN Engine:
(CMMN引擎的设计原理与Flowable项目的其他引擎相同。下图给出了使用CMMN引擎时涉及的不同组件的高级概述：)

From a high level point of view:
(从高层次来看：)

* A *CmmnEngine* instance is created from a *CmmnEngineConfiguration*. The configuration instance can be created from a configuration file or programmatically.
(一个CmmnEngine实例是从CmmnEngineConfiguration创建的。可以从配置文件或以编程方式创建配置实例。)

* The _CmmnEngine_ gives access the Flowable CMMN API's in the form of services: *CmmnRepositoryService*, *CmmnRuntimeService*, *CmmnTaskService*, *CmmnHistoryService*, *CmmnManagementService*. The naming of the services and their responsibilities is similar to the other engines.
(CmmnEngine以服务的形式提供对Flowable CMMN API的访问：CmmnRepositoryService、CmmnRuntimeService、CmmnTaskService、CmmnHistoryService、CmmnManagementService。服务的命名及其职责与其他引擎类似。)

* Every API method is transformed into a *Command* instance. This _Command_ instance is passed into the *CommandExecutor* which, amongst others, makes it pass a stack of *CommandInterceptors*. These interceptors have various responsibilities, including handling transactions.
(每个API方法都转换为Command实例，此Command实例传递给CommandExecutor，其中包括使一些CommandInterceptors。这些拦截器具有各种职责，包括处理事务。)

* Eventually, the _Command_ typically (unless it's a pure data modification _Command_) plans a *CmmnOperation* on the *CmmnEngineAgenda*.
(最终，Command通常（除非是纯数据修改命令）在CmmnEngineAgenda上计划CmmnOperation。)

* Operations will be taken from the _CmmnEngineAgenda_ until no more operations are left. Typically, an operation will plan new operations as part of its logic.
(操作将从CmmnEngineAgenda中获取，直到不再进行操作为止。通常，操作将计划新操作作为其逻辑的一部分。)

* The logic in the operations will call out to lower-level services and/or entity managers.
(操作中的逻辑将调用较低级别的服务和/或实体管理器。)

A big difference between the BPMN and the CMMN engine is that the BPMN engine is generally 'local': the engine looks at the current state, checks what is ahead in the process and continues (of course this is a simplification, there are plenty of operations where this doesn't apply, but for making a distinction conceptually, it is correct). The CMMN engine works differently: in CMMN, data plays an important role and the change of data can trigger many things in various places in the case definition. For this reason, the *EvaluateCriteriaOperation* is planned and executed often whenever changes happen. The engine does optimize these evaluations when it detects duplicates or useless evaluations.
(BPMN和CMMN引擎之间的一个很大区别是BPMN引擎通常是“本地的”：引擎查看当前状态，检查进程中的前面的信息并继续（当然这是一个简化，这有很多不适用的操作，但从概念上做出区分，这是正确的）。CMMN引擎的工作方式不同：在CMMN中，数据起着重要作用，数据的更改可以在案例定义中的各个位置触发很多事情。因此，只要发生更改，就会经常计划和执行EvaluateCriteriaOperation。当检测到重复或无用的评估时，引擎会对这些评估进行优化。)

Core to the working of the CMMN engine is the concept of a *Plan item instance*, a representation of which _plan items_ currently are _live_ in the case and which state they have. Quite different from BPMN, CMMN defines a strict state lifecyle for the plan items. This is represented in the _CmmnRuntimeService_ methods, the query API's and the data fields part of the *PlanItemInstance* object.
(CMMN引擎工作的核心是计划项目实例的概念，表示当前在案例中存在哪些计划项目以及它们具有哪种状态。与BPMN完全不同，CMMN为计划项定义了严格的状态生命周期。这在CmmnRuntimeService方法，查询API和PlanItemInstance对象的数据字段部分中表示。)

The working of the agenda, the operations and how plan item instances are handled can be inspected by setting logging to debug for the agenda package. For example, when using log4j:
(可以通过将日志记录设置为议程包的调试来检查议程的工作，操作以及如何处理计划项实例。例如，使用log4j时：)

```
log4j.logger.org.flowable.cmmn.engine.impl.agenda=DEBUG
```

Which leads to logging like:
(这样记录的信息如下：)
